 * Grakn is the main entry point to connect to a Grakn Knowledge Graph.

 * To connect to a knowledge graph, first make sure you have a Grakn Engine server running. You can also instantiate
 * an in-memory knowledge graph for testing or experimentation purposes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To establish a connection, you first need to obtain a {@link GraknGraphFactory} by calling
 * the {@link #factory(String, String)} method. A {@link GraknGraphFactory} to a given physical
 * location and specific database instance within that location. Once you've instantiated a factory, 
 * you can obtain multiple concurrent graph connections, represented by the {@link GraknGraph}
 * interface.
