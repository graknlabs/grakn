/**

 * A {@link VarPattern} may be given a variable, or use an "anonymous" variable. {@code Graql} provides

 * The methods on {@link VarPattern} are used to set its properties. A {@link VarPattern} behaves differently depending
 * on the type of query its used in. In a {@link MatchQuery}, a {@link VarPattern} describes the properties any matching
 * concept must have. In an {@link InsertQuery}, it describes the properties that should be set on the inserted concept.
 * In a {@link DeleteQuery}, it describes the properties that should be deleted.
