## Disclaimer  
We don't claim MindmapsDB will change your life, though it may improve it: we'll leave that for you to decide.  But if you lose a billion dollars or a limb while using MindmapsDB, that's not our fault. We reserve the right to
do the absolute minimum provided by law, up to and including nothing.

This is basically the same disclaimer that comes with all software
packages, but it is in plain English. Thanks for your understanding.
