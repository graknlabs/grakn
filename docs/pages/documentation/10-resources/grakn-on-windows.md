## Windows Support

GRAKN is currently not supported natively on Windows. This is due to beta status of [Cassandra 2.1 on Windows](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-10673).

Your current options are:
- a virtual machine with Ubuntu (eg. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)) 
- [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) with our [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/graknlabs/grakn/)
