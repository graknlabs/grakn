For a comprehensive guide to migration, please see both our [Migration Tutorial](../migration/migration-overview.html) and our additional documentation specific to [OWL Migration](../migration/OWL-migration.html).

## Introduction
This example addresses the topic of OWL interoperability through a migration of a family tree OWL ontology. The code for this example can be found in our [github repository](https://github.com/graknlabs/sample-projects/tree/master/example-owl-migration).

The sole prerequisite of this example is having the Grakn environment installed and the Engine running. If you need help starting Grakn Engine, please see the [setup guide](../get-started/setup-guide.html).

### Running the example
You can run this example by running the [`Main`](https://github.com/graknlabs/sample-projects/blob/master/example-owl-migration/src/main/java/Main.java) class. Check out the `OWLResourceMigrator` class for the bulk of the migration code.  

We run a few queries in the example to prove that the data has been migrated. After running the example, you should be able to answer the following questions (see the bottom of the page for answers - but please don't peek until you've tried it!):

+ What are the Types in the Family Tree knowledge base in Grakn?
+ How many people are in the family tree?
+ How many descendants does Eleanor Pringle have?
+ Who are the great uncles of Ethel Archer?

## Test Yourself Answers

**What are the Types in the Family Tree knowledge base?**   
Answer:

```
tThing
tPerson
tMan
tWoman
```     	

**How many people are in the family tree?**   

Answer: `411`

**How many descendants does Eleanor Pringle have?**   

Answer: `55`

Answer:   

```

## Where next?

After running this OWL migration, check out the [Graql documentation](../graql/graql-overview.html) and the [Graph API documentation](../developing-with-java/java-api.html) for more instructions on how you can explore the family tree.
