{% include warning.html content="**Please note that there is no official support for Windows, although we expect it to be added later to GRAKN.AI. This is a suggested workaround.**" %}

## Windows Support

GRAKN is currently not supported natively on Windows.

Your current options are:
- a virtual machine with Ubuntu (eg. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads))
- [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) with our [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/graknlabs/grakn/)
