This section contains an overview of available options regarding Grakn deployments in the cloud.

    
## Google Cloud Platform

Google Cloud Platform, offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search and YouTube. 
Alongside a set of management tools, it provides a series of modular cloud services including computing, data storage, data analytics and machine learning.

Google Cloud Launcher lets you quickly deploy functional software packages that run on Google Cloud Platform. Even if you are unfamiliar with services like Compute Engine or Cloud Storage, 
you can easily start up a familiar software package without having to manually configure the software, virtual machine instances, storage, or network settings.
