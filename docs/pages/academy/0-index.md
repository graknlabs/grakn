Welcome to the Grakn Academy. In this series of tutorials, you will learn all the basics of Grakn - the knowledge graph for knowledge engineering.

The Academy is structured into modules that cover broad Grakn topics. Each module is divided into several lessons, that you are supposed to follow in order.

The Academy lessons are sprinkled with exercises, that you are highly advised to do, as they will help to solidify your understanding of the topics covered.
