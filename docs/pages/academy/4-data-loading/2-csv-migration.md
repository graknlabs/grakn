In the last lesson, you should have learned how to load a file containing a (potentially very long) list of Graql statements into Grakn.

As it is very likely that if you are migrating a pre-existing database to Grakn, your data will not be stored in Graql files. We need a way to load other more common file formats, like CSV, into our knowledge graph.

To do this, we added another powerful tool to Graql. Meet the Graql templating language.

## Templates
A template file is just a file written in Graql (with some added features) that acts as a filter: you "pipe" your data-file through it and out comes Grakn digestible data.

Let’s write a template to migrate oil platforms into our knowledge graph. First of all have a look at the content of the `platfrom.csv` file (you can find the file [here](https://github.com/graknlabs/academy/blob/master/short-training/data/platforms.csv)). A CSV file is nothing more than a table: the first line contains the header with the column names (in this case ID, DistCoast, Country and BelongsTo). The lines after the first contain the data separated by commas (or sometimes some other characters).

A Graql template file looks as simple as this:

```graql-template
insert $x isa oil-platform has platform-id <ID>
has distance-from-coast <DistCoast>;
```

This is nothing else than a simple Graql statement with the added variables in angle brackets, that contain some of the column names of the CSV file.

When you try and load the CSV file using this template (we’ll see how in a short while), Grakn scans every line of the file and produces a Graql statement substituting the column names with the appropriate values and batch load it.

For example: if the line currently being scanned reads

```
13,24,Italy,ENI
```

Our template will produce the statement

```graql-skip-test
insert $x isa oil-platform has platform-id "13"
has distance-from-coast "24";
```


## Flow control
If you took a careful look at the CSV file containing the information about the oil platforms, you probably noticed that the value of DistCoast is not always present. If we were to run our current template against the csv, Grakn would try to add empty distance to coast with values and bad things would ensue.

To avoid that, we need to introduce the second Graql extension used in the templating language: flow control. More commonly known as "if then" statements. In our templating language, an "if" statement looks like `if (CONDITION) do { STUFF TO BE ADDED }`.
Modify the template to look like the following statement:

```graql-template
insert $x isa oil-platform has platform-id <ID>
if (<DistCoast> != "") do {
has distance-from-coast <DistCoast>}
;
```

Let us examine the additions one by one, it’s nothing too hard.

As you know, when running this template against a CSV file, the latter is scanned line by line and each line is converted into a Graql statement. When you add an "if", the content of the curly braces is added to the Graql statement only if the condition within the parentheses holds true.

The condition to be evaluated is a simple check on the value of one of the columns. In this case `<DistCoast> != ""` means that the value of the column DistCoast is not (that is what `!=` stands for) empty.

Every time the DistCoast column is empty the Graql statement sent to Grakn will look like this:

```graql
insert $x isa oil-platform has platform-id "123";
```

Notice that the last semicolon comes after the curly braces, so it gets added every time, independently of the value of DistCoast.

## Macros
There is one more thing to add to our template before we can actually use it.
If you revisit the last paragraphs, you will notice that the example Graql statement into which the template gets translated looks like

```graql-skip-test
insert $x isa oil-platform has platform-id "13"
has distance-from-coast "24";
```

Do you notice the quotes around 24 (that is the value of `distance-from-coast`)? This happens because every attribute is read as a string, but in our schema we have defined it as an attribute of datatype long.

If you try and use the template now, Grakn will throw a validation error because you are trying to insert "string" values into "long" attributes. To solve the issues we need macros.

A macro in Graql is a snippet of code that does some useful data manipulation to help migrate things into your knowledge graph. Macros always look like `@MACRO_NAME(ARGUMENT)` where the specific macro is applied to whatever is in the parentheses. There are several macros that come with the language, but the most used ones are those needed to convert strings into other datatypes (and they are called, not surprisingly, @long, @double, @date and @boolean).

Let’s add our macro to the template:

```graql-template
insert $x isa oil-platform has platform-id <ID>
if (<DistCoast> != "") do {
has distance-from-coast @long(<DistCoast>)}
;
```

That’s all! A lot of words for what is really a slightly modified very simple Graql query! Save your template file as something like `oil-platform-template.gql` and you are ready to use it.


## Migration
To use the template you need the following command

`graql migration csv -k KEYSPACE -i INPUT_FILE -t TEMPLATE_FILE`

Try it now using the template you just created (or you use the `platform-template.gql` file from your training directory), the input file `platforms.csv`, and the keyspace you created when you loaded the schema during last lesson.

After that, check that oil platforms are in your knowledge graph.

### GOOD TO KNOW:
Why aren’t you using the template file you just wrote and using one stored in the VM instead? That is because the VM is isolated from the rest of the computer (or, as it is called, the host machine). Before being able to use the gql file you created into the VM, you would have to move it from the host machine to the VM. There are many ways of doing that, but are definitely out of the scope of these lessons. Extra points if you manage to find how and to actually migrate the data using the template you have written instead of the one we provided!


### What have you learned?
In this lesson, you have learned about the Graql templating language, macros and how to migrate CSV files into Grakn. That was quite a lot, so be sure that you have understood all the topics of this lesson before you proceed.

## What next?
The [next lesson](./xml-migration.html) will be about migrating files with a more complex structure than the tabular one of CSV. If you want to delve deeper into the Graql templating language and macros, as usual, head to the [docs](../index.html).
