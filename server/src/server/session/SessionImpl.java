 * The role of the Session is to provide multiple independent transactions that can be used by clients to
 * access a specific keyspace.
 *
 * NOTE:
 *  - Only 1 transaction per thread can exist.
 *  - A transaction cannot be shared between multiple threads, each thread will need to get a new transaction from a session.
