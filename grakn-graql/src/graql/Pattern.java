/**
 * A pattern describing a subgraph.

 * A {@code Pattern} can describe an entire graph, or just a single concept.
 * <p>
 * For example, {@code var("x").isa("movie")} is a pattern representing things that are movies.
 * <p>
 * A pattern can also be a conjunction: {@code and(var("x").isa("movie"), var("x").value("Titanic"))}, or a disjunction:
 * {@code or(var("x").isa("movie"), var("x").isa("tv-show"))}. These can be used to combine other patterns together
 * into larger patterns.
