/**
 * <p>
 * Main program to migrate an OWL knowledge base into a Mindmaps knowledge graph. Expected 
 * arguments are an OWL file and a Mindmaps Engine URL. At a minimum an OWL file must be provided. 
 * Note that the OWLAPI is not very good at intelligently resolving imports, such as looking in the
 * same folder etc. To import a large ontology made up of multiple imports scattered around in files, 
 * the easiest thing is to use protege to "merge" them into a single ontology file with all axioms 
 * inside it.
